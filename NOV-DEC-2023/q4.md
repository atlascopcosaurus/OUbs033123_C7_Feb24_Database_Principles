To illustrate the normalization process up to the third normal form (3NF) for the provided "Staff Allocation" table, I will explain the steps and show the resulting tables after each normal form. This process reduces redundancy and eliminates the various anomalies in the database.

### Unnormalized Table: Staff Allocation
Here is the original unnormalized "Staff Allocation" table:

| StaffID | BranchNo | BranchAddress     | Name       | Position         | HoursPerWeek |
|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| S1055   | B002     | Headquarters, ... | Jean Paul  | Assistant Manager| 15           |
| S1055   | B004     | Avenue Street,... | Jean Paul  | Assistant Manager| 8            |
| ...     | ...      | ...               | ...        | ...              | ...          |

### First Normal Form (1NF)
1NF requires the elimination of repeating groups, ensuring each column is atomic, and the establishment of a primary key.

**Staff Table:**

| StaffID | Name       |
|---------|------------|
| S1055   | Jean Paul  |
| S1311   | Suzanne    |
| S1112   | Sam Dilloo |
| ...     | ...        |

**Branch Table:**

| BranchNo | BranchAddress     |
|----------|-------------------|
| B002     | Headquarters, ... |
| B004     | Avenue Street,... |
| B005     | Royal Street,...  |
| ...      | ...               |

**Allocation Table:**

| StaffID | BranchNo | Position         | HoursPerWeek |
|---------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| S1055   | B002     | Assistant Manager| 15           |
| S1055   | B004     | Assistant Manager| 8            |
| ...     | ...      | ...              | ...          |

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
2NF requires that the table is in 1NF and that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. Since in our case, `StaffID` and `BranchNo` together form a composite key, and all non-key attributes are dependent on this full key, our 1NF tables are already in 2NF.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
3NF requires that the table is in 2NF and that there are no transitive functional dependencies; non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes.

**Allocation Table (3NF):**

| StaffID | BranchNo | Position         | HoursPerWeek |
|---------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| S1055   | B002     | Assistant Manager| 15           |
| S1055   | B004     | Assistant Manager| 8            |
| ...     | ...      | ...              | ...          |

In 3NF, the tables remain the same as in 2NF since there were no transitive dependencies in the 2NF tables; the non-key attributes did not depend on other non-key attributes.

Through normalization, we've separated the data into distinct tables to minimize redundancy (no more repetitive branch or staff information), addressed update anomalies (updating a branch address doesn't require multiple row updates), and resolved insertion and deletion anomalies (staff and branches can be added or removed without affecting other unrelated data). This structure also optimizes the integrity and efficiency of database operations.
